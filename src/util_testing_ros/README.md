# UTIL TESTING ROS

This helper library provides utilities to make ros unit testing easier. It provides functions to:
- check and wait for incoming messages (see [listener](include/util_testing_ros/listener.hpp))
- wait for starting nodes (see [initialization](include/util_testing_ros/initialization.hpp))
- handle and control the simulated time (see [time_controller](include/util_testing_ros/time_controller.hpp))

Have a look at the Doxygen doc for more information.
